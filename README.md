# Git Lesson

this will cover the basics of using git for version control

This lesson is for the first day of the MSSE bootcamp.

to make a commit/version/checkpoint of your files,
follow this procedure:
1. make changes to your project that you would like to keep
2. when you have your changes, tell git you are ready to create a commit by
adding files to the staging area using "git add filename"
3. create a commit using 'git commit -m "message about what you did"'
//you can also unstage files with restore
